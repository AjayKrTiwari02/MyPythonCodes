Destructors are called when an object gets destroyed. In Python, destructors are not needed
 as much as in C++ because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management 
 automatically.

It is called when all references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object
 is garbage collected.
 def __del__(self):
  # body of destructor
