Object Oriented Programming:

Object Oriented Programming Structure : 

	Workes on the concept of classes and object.
	A class is a blueprint or template to create object.
	Converts the problem in object and builds data and function around the object.

	classes : Its a blueprint from which indivisual objects are created.
	object : Its an instance of a class , when class is defined , a template or info is also defined .			
 	Memory is allocated after object creation.

	Data  Encapsulation :

	Inheritance :

	Polymorphism :

	Exception handling:

1) Better code reusability using object ,
2) Data hiding use for builds secure system.
3) Software complexity can be easily managed.
