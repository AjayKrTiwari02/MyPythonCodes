INHERITANCE :



1) In the programming in OOPS helps us to build program resusability.
    The concept of reusability is supported using inheritance.
2) We reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it.
3) The existing class is called base class.
4) The new class which is inherited from the base class is called derived class.
5) There are different inheritance concept :
a) Single Inheritance : A derived class is inherited with only one base class.
b) Multiple Inheritance : multiple parent with one child.
c)Hierarchical Inheritance : one parent multiple child.
d)Multilevel Inheritance : one parent one child one grand child.
e)Hybrid Inheritance:The process of combining more than one type of Inheritance 
							together while deriving subclasses in a program is called 
							a Hybrid Inheritance.
